**Hauler**: A cheap, slow cargo vessel. A common sight in peaceful sectors or used for intra-system mining operations where it can be easily escorted and is never far from help.

**Commerce Liner**: Wealthy corporations dedicated to interstellar shipping developed these hulls as a balance between vulnerable bulk freighters and smaller free merchant ships. The ship can haul a significant amount of cargo while still maintaining some agility and defensive capacity.

**Clipper**: A sleek and agile ship designed for speed, this hull is often used to ferry high value data, people, or small cargo at speed between systems while still providing some level of protection. Its single hardpoint makes it vulnerable, but it's speed allows it to make a fast escape in the hands of a skilled pilot. (*Note: This is intended to replace the Naval Courier hull from Skyward Steel*)

**Strike Cruiser**: For wealthy polities that don't wish to commit to Capital class hulls, the Strike Cruiser is a supped up Fleet Cruiser that leaves room for dedicated small craft defenses while maintaining its general firepower.

**Battlecruiser**: The smallest useful capital class ship design. Significant sacrifices in armor and downscaled ship components still allow the vessel to support fearsome capital class weaponry.

**Tiny Station**: This cluster of hab modules and structural beams barely qualifies as a station, but is a cheap solution for remote outposts or fueling stations. While vulnerable to focused attack, it is usually constructed along allied patrol routes or has fighters docked and ready.
